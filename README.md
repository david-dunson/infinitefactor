Bayesian infinite factor modelling

This package was developed for modular construction of Bayesian factor samplers using a variety of data models and priors. Bayesian factor models are key tools for performing reproducible and robust dimension reduction and modelling complex relationships among sets of regressors. Accounting for structure with factor models allows both efficiencies in estimation, and inference on that structure. Popular shrinkage priors (MGSP, Dirichlet-Laplace, others) have been formulated for the factor loadings matrix that do not require prespecified covariate grouping or order-dependence. This package aims to implement those priors for use with multiple data models in an easy, straightforward, and fast environment for application, as well as encourage further model and prior development through use of modular and exchangable parameter updates.
